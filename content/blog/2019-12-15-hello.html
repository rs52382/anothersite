<h1>REGEX</h1>
<p>When being introduced to Python during the last unit this semester, I found the use of regular expressions, or REGEX for short, to be amazingly efficient in use of large sets of data. I definitely appreciated becoming proficient in R, but learning some Python basics seemed like a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>During the second homework assignment was when I was really tested with my REGEX skills in Python. Using <code>re.findall</code> throughout the homework provided the epiphany that there was a plethora of possibilities that could be used with <code>re.findall</code> alone when analyzing strings of data. For example, the following question challenged me:</p>
<p><em>Using <code>re.findall()</code>, match all latex math-mode text (anything wrapped in <code>$</code>, including the <code>$</code>s) in the string below (string4).</em></p>
<p>I was stuck for a solid hour, but after a lot of trial and error, I was able to come up with the following code:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>string4=r&quot;We try to quantitatively capture these characteristics by defining a set of indexes,\
which can be computed using the mosaic image and the corresponding ground truth: \
\begin{itemize} \
    \item $\mu_{A_T}$ and $\sigma_{A_T}$, the mean and standard deviation of the tiles area $A_T$, respectively; \
    \item $\rho_\text{filler}$, the ratio between the filler area and the overall mosaic are, computed as \
$\rho_\text{filler}=\frac{\sum_{T \in \mathcal{T} A_T}}{A}$, being $A$ the area of the mosaic; \
    \item \todo{does it worth?}; \
    \item \todo{does it worth?}; \
    \item $\mu_{C_T}$, the mean of the tiles \emph{color dispersion} $C_T$, \
being $C_T = \sigma_R+\sigma_G+\sigma_B$, where $\sigma_R$, $\sigma_G$ and $\sigma_B$ are the \
standard deviation of the red, green and blue channel values of the pixels within the tile $T$.\
After applying a method to an image, we compare the segmented image (i.e., the result) \
against the ground truth and assess the performance according to the following three metrics: \
\begin{itemize} \
    \item average tile precision $P$ \
    \item average tile recall $R$ \
    \item tile count error $C$&quot;

import re
re.findall(r&quot;\$[^$]+\$&quot;,string4)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [&#39;$\\mu_{A_T}$&#39;, &#39;$\\sigma_{A_T}$&#39;, &#39;$A_T$&#39;, &#39;$\\rho_\\text{filler}$&#39;, &#39;$\\rho_\\text{filler}=\\frac{\\sum_{T \\in \\mathcal{T} A_T}}{A}$&#39;, &#39;$A$&#39;, &#39;$\\mu_{C_T}$&#39;, &#39;$C_T$&#39;, &#39;$C_T = \\sigma_R+\\sigma_G+\\sigma_B$&#39;, &#39;$\\sigma_R$&#39;, &#39;$\\sigma_G$&#39;, &#39;$\\sigma_B$&#39;, &#39;$T$&#39;, &#39;$P$&#39;, &#39;$R$&#39;, &#39;$C$&#39;]</code></pre>
<p>Although a short bit of code, the content in it is staggering in effect. The thing I’ve enjoyed about Python is how it’s a lot more logic based with a higher learning curve than R. Don’t get me wrong, I like R a lot: it creates a lot prettier plots and figures (thank you ggplot!), but learning both languages will definitely come of good use in my future.</p>
